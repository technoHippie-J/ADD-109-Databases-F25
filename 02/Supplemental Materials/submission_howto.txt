How to Submit Critical Thinking Assignments

When submitting your Critical Thinking Exercise assignments, you need to include both a SQL script file and a video. Optionally, you might also want to include your original database for later assignments. Here is what I would like to see:

Requirements for SQL script files:
- SQL script files should have a .sql file extension. (You can create this in VS Code and open it in SQLite Studio to run it, or create it in SQLite Studio and save it from there.)
- All SQL statements should be included. I would like to be able to run your script to re-create your work.
- Comments should be included to indicate what you are trying to accomplish and what database(s) you are using.

Requirements for videos:
- You may use your preferred screen capture software (e.g. Panopto, Zoom, Screencast.com)
- Narrate with audio if possible.
- Briefly show me how your script works and tell me what you are trying to accomplish.

NOTES:
- You can upload an .mp4 file (or .mov if you are on a Mac).
- If you are using PANOPTO, you will need to SHARE the video. To see how to set sharing, view Using Panopto to create video.
- If you upload your video to a public site like YouTube, please set the viewing options to Unlisted or equivalent and provide an appropriate sharable link.

Requirements for optional database files:
- SQL database files should use a .db file extension. (.sqlite or .sqlite3 are also acceptable).

Submitting multiple attachments in Canvas:
- If you have a .sql file and a video URL:
    - OPTION 1) Submit your .sql file using the File Upload option. Paste the video URL into the comments.
    - OPTION 2) Submit twice. First submit the .sql file with File Upload, then submit the video URL separately.

If you have a .sql file and a .mp4 file:
- Use the File Upload option and + Add Another File
